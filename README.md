♦ This is a **Breast Cancer Prediction project**. This is a classification-based project, that classifies whether a given instance, such as a patient's medical data, indicates the presence of breast cancer or not.

♦ **Classification** in machine learning is the process of teaching a computer program to recognize and categorize things based on patterns. Classification is a type of supervised learning because it relies on labeled data to train the program. The goal is to build a model that can accurately classify new data by identifying similarities and differences in the patterns it has learned. The classification model that is used is Random Forest.

♦ **Random Forest** is a popular machine learning algorithm that is widely used for classification and regression tasks. It is an ensemble learning method that combines multiple decision trees to make predictions.

♦ All the work is done on Jupiter Notebook, Django framework is used.
